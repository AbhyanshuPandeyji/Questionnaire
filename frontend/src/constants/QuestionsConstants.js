        question: "How to Plan A Project / A month",
        answer: `- **Formula To Follow to Set and Achieve Goals:**
    \n1. **Step 1: Decide Exactly What you want.  Either Decide By Self or Sit With Boss.** ( One of the worst use of time is to do something very well that need not to be done at all )
    \n2. **Step 2: Write It Down. When You  Write It on Paper You Make it tangible.** ( Unwritten Goals lead to confusion , vagueness , misdirection and mistakes )
    \n3. **Step 3: Set A Deadline. Set Subdeadlines if necessary.** A goal without a deadline has no real urgency. No beginning and No end. Very Little will be done ( Paetro Principle , Work Expands to Fill up the Time Available. )
    \n4. **Step 4: Make A list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal.  (** As I discover new things added to your list. Keep byilding your list until its complete.  Gives Picture to larger Task and Objectve. )
    \n5. **Step 5: Organize That List Into A Plan.** ( Organize that List by Priority and Sequence. What needs to be done first and what next. Even Better Would Be laying out plan in Visual From using boxes and arrows to make relationship to each other - eg two similar task together. ) ****
    \n6. **Step 6: Take Action on plan Immediately.** ( Do Something , Anything. A Average Plan Executed is Far better than Brilliant Plan never done anything in )
    \n7. **Step 7: Resolve To do something every single day that moves me toward my major goal. ( Build Activity in your daily schedule. Habit of it , Habit of doing it )**`,

        question: "What is a goal and how to follow it",
        answer: `***Hard Work, Experience, Skills and Success cannot be bought its Earned. Make sure i understand it correctly. ( I cannot bypass it I will have to do it in-order to get it ).\***

1. **Have own take , and creative vision towards the goal. What kind of ideas and work suits what goal.** ( Having a start a middle and a finish for that goal and what it looks like when it finished ( the story and reason behind it ) )
\n 2. **Don’t play catchup.** ( Always someone else comes up in something else )
\n3. **Don’t do constant course correction , keep the way of developing similar in order to progress , and to introduce changes and new ideas from it.** ( don’t go in panic if something doesn’t work out , maybe something else if exists can be used to do to achieve similar result. Instead of having new goals each new week , which either comprise of new desires or the similar goals but with just new coat of paint each week )
\n4. **Don’t create new goals every next fucking week or write old goals / things that i already know again in list. Stick and re-return to old created lists and goals.** (no need to create new goals each time i hit panic ) ( just go back and re see those lists and goals again to get a look again )(and not starting same goal from the starting point each time. ) 
\n5. **Play in pointers instead of bunch of data or information.** ( there will be new perspective or refreshed perspective on old one, for that watch old behaviors list of my own , anyone thats gone or acomplished , delete it , and move to done list.
\n6. **Restrict the lists and sources to get my information from for same exact thing.** ( Have every major point written into one place and keep looking at those that are necessary and required at a same place , not mess or excess , rather pin pointed. )
\n7. **Be objective , get the thing out i want not what will all be there to watch ,** ( eg:  when reading own things such as old or current behavior , go to the main pointers , what is the main that present main issue , and not everything else written beside or in the entire list , be intentional ) ( if many things present same idea , condense and delete the rest. ) ( and dont add unwanted / unneccessary more and more objective to acomplish a simpler thing. )( breakdown in smaller and samller and start solving first and solvable problems and start adding up them together to solve the bigger one , start working from smaller to bigger )
\n8. **Nothing is garunteed.** ( even if i have all the things to be successful in a thing , i might still fail , and same can be opposite , even if i dont have everything its required i might still win if i am good at the main things that it demands , and others can be attained and improve over time. )
\n9. **winner and loosers have same goal what seperates them is the system they follow to achive the goals.**
\n10. Be Consistent to the Goal and System and logical brain. ( Being similar and then breaking out a bit gives more value to same act , in comparison to being breakout all the time and having a consistent behavior once in a while , be consistent in doing better in something , not everything has to be looked from the lens of being comfortable in your level , it can be more than that , it could be building a base today in order to attack tomorrow better ).

***So decide where i will put my efforts in to gain all of these in-order to succeed.***

***So whats my arc and storyline of my life i want to tell from my each day i spend , and is it actually looking like it will go that way? A Question to myself everytime i think of just being bad.***`,

        question: `what is mvc model`,
        answer: `🧠 MVC Model — Explained Simply
\nMVC stands for Model–View–Controller.
It is a design pattern used to structure your code — especially in web and software applications — to separate concerns and make the code clean, modular, and maintainable.

✅\n Breakdown of MVC:
\nComponent	Role / What It Does	Example (To-do App)
\nModel	Manages data and business logic	Stores tasks in a database
\nView	Handles UI / what the user sees and interacts with	Displays task list to the user
\nController	Handles user input, connects View & Model	When user adds a task, controller updates the model and refreshes the view

\n\n🛠️ How They Work Together:
\n1. User interacts with the View (clicks "Add Task")
\n2. Controller catches this action
\n3. Controller tells the Model to update the data
\n4. Model updates the database
\n5. Controller tells the View to refresh
\n6. View updates on screen to show new data`,

        question: `What is promises in javascript `,
        answer: `1️⃣ What is a Promise in JavaScript?
\n👉 A Promise is a special JavaScript object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation — either:

\nThe operation completed successfully (fulfilled/resolved)

\nThe operation failed (rejected)

\n💡 Think of it like:

\n📦 A container for a value you don’t have yet but will get in the future.

\n\n🔹 Why use Promises?
\n✅ Handle async operations (API calls, file reads) cleanly
\n✅ Avoid deeply nested callbacks (callback hell)

\n\n🔹 Promise states
\nState	Meaning
\nPending	Still working (initial state)
\nFulfilled (Resolved)	Completed successfully
\nRejected	Failed

\n\n🔹 Example
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
});

promise.then(result => console.log(result)) // prints "Success!" after 1 sec
       .catch(error => console.log(error));`,

        question: `What is a Closure in JavaScript?`,
        answer: `2️⃣ What is a Closure in JavaScript?
\n👉 A closure happens when:
\n➡ A function remembers and can access variables from its outer (parent) scope, even after that outer function has finished executing.

\n💡 Think of it like:

\n🎁 A function carries a “backpack” of the variables it had access to when it was created.

\n\n🔹 Why are closures useful?
\n✅ Data privacy (e.g. creating private variables)
\n✅ Functions that “remember” context
\n✅ Used in event handlers, callbacks, factories`,

        question: `How can we access document elements in JavaScript?`,
        answer: `How can we access document elements in JavaScript?
\n✅ We use DOM (Document Object Model) methods to select elements on a web page.

\n\n🔹 Common ways to access elements:
\nMethod	What it selects	Example
\ndocument.getElementById()	Element with specific ID	document.getElementById("myDiv")
\ndocument.getElementsByClassName()	All elements with a class (HTMLCollection)	document.getElementsByClassName("item")
\ndocument.getElementsByTagName()	All elements with a tag	document.getElementsByTagName("p")
\ndocument.querySelector()	First match for CSS selector	document.querySelector(".btn")
\ndocument.querySelectorAll()	All matches for CSS selector (NodeList)	document.querySelectorAll(".item")

        question: `\n What is sql and no sql databases , what are  their key differences and how do they function differently `,
        answer: `\n \n ✅ Great question! Let’s break it down clearly so you understand what SQL and NoSQL databases are, how they work, and how they differ — especially useful when deciding between MongoDB (NoSQL) and SQL databases for your projects.

🌟 \n \n What is SQL Database?
👉 SQL = Structured Query Language
➡ SQL databases (also called relational databases) store data in tables (rows & columns) with a fixed schema (structure).

✅ Examples:

MySQL

PostgreSQL

Microsoft SQL Server

Oracle DB

💡 Think of it like:

📊 A spreadsheet — every row is a record, every column has a defined data type.

🌟 What is NoSQL Database?
👉 NoSQL = Not Only SQL
➡ NoSQL databases are non-relational → they store data in a flexible, schema-less format (or with dynamic schema).

✅ Examples:

MongoDB (document store)

Redis (key-value store)

Cassandra (wide-column store)

Neo4j (graph database)

💡 Think of it like:

📦 A collection of JSON-like documents or objects.`,
