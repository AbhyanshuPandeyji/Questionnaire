          there were many hiccups here and there in the way that lead my life into a wrong and sometimes a very
          painful paths, yet at same time i learned a lot from them , i got lost into the moment many times in life.
          And trying to figure out the way to live my life and make something out of it which makes me better out of
          what i was before.

          and life lessons i am going to figure out in life and as i go along i will make more memory and more experience to one day
